    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.
  

## About Me
---
I hold a double degree in Business Informatics and Entrepreneurship & Innovation Management, specializing in human-centered and sustainable Artificial Intelligence. My research focuses on generative and agentic AI, exploring how these technologies reshape digital work, service science, and human-AI collaboration. Building on experience in IT-driven process optimization and enterprise AI projects with organizations like Campana & Schott and the Institute for Ecological Economy Research, I investigate the design and impact of AI systems on organizations and society.
