summary: What does a document management system look like that not only digitizes but also actively thinks along, analyzes, and takes action?
abstract: 'At the Partner Days of Starke + Reichert GmbH & Co. KG, Mahei M. Li, David Sonnabend, and Philipp Reinhard presented the University of Kassel’s project GenKITs to around 80 partners of the Starke-DMS network. The presentation outlined the evolution from static single agents to dynamic multi-agent systems capable of autonomous cooperation and decision-making. Using deep user interviews, co-creative workshops, and future research methods such as forecasting and backcasting, the team developed a vision for the future of document management. Key highlights included an agentic AI landscape, practical examples such as DocClassifier and DocAnalyst, and discussions of design challenges for agentic systems. The main takeaways emphasized the transition from GenAI to AgenticAI, from use cases to agents as co-workers, from problem-solution pairs to prompts, and from single agents to multi-agent systems while shaping a forward-looking vision of document management. The project is supported by the Hessian Ministry for Digitalization and Innovation and WIBank.'
