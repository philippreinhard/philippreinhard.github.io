abstract: Customer support service employees are facing an increased workload, while artificial intelligence (AI) appears to possess the potential to change the way we work. With the advent of modern types of generative AI, new opportunities to augment frontline service employees have emerged. However, little is known about how to integrate generative AI in customer support service organizations and purposefully change service employee work routines. Following multi-method qualitative research, we performed a literature review, conducted workshops, and interviewed IT support agents, managers, and AI experts. Thereby, we examine AI augmentation for frontline service employees in the context of IT support to carve out where and how GenAI can be leveraged to develop more efficient and higher-quality customer support. Our resulting framework reveals that especially adapting solutions and retaining knowledge is subject to a high degree of AI augmentation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study explores how generative AI can augment frontline customer support employees by reshaping their work routines and improving service efficiency. Through literature review, workshops, and interviews, the research develops a framework showing that solution adaptation and knowledge retention benefit most from AI augmentation.
