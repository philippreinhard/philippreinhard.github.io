In the HUB, we support ten collaborative projects from various sectors, including public administration, healthcare, tourism, mechanical and plant engineering, and construction. All of them are currently developing sustainable, data-driven innovations. Our scientific mission is to identify cross-cutting challenges within these initiatives and pool efforts in finding solutions. We aim to answer: What characterizes a successful business model transformation? What is crucial when developing data strategies within an ecosystem? How can organizations, work, and skills be sustainably transformed?
