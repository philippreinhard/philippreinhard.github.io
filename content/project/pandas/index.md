The HISS project advanced IT support by developing five key technologies: an analytics pipeline for trend detection and solution quality assessment, a ticket matching system leveraging historical data, a bandit labeling system for improved ticket resolution, a routing script for efficient ticket assignment, and tools like the Whisper Assistant and FAQ Generator for real-time support and knowledge creation. These prototypes remain available for future research, promising lasting improvements in support processes and paving the way for more sophisticated systems.
