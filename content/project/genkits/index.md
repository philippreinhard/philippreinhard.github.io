The GenKITS project leverages large language models and generative AI to develop agents that support and automate complex business processes. A GPT-based orchestrator enables employees to create AI applications in a low-code/no-code environment using prompt engineering and conversational design, fostering both process optimization and AI literacy. The solution, which also allows API integration with tools like ChatGPT, is provided as open-source technology.
