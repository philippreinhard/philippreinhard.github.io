In the SusIE Hub, we work together with innovative R&D projects to unlock the economic, ecological, and social sustainability potential of smart services. Through collaboration between academia, tech companies, industrial corporations, and especially small and medium-sized enterprises, we develop concepts to successfully anchor the generated ideas and solutions in practice over the long term. This lays the foundation for sustainable transfer and vibrant innovation ecosystems.
