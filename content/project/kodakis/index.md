The KoDaKIS project "Conception of Data-Driven AI Services", initiated in cooperation between the Chair of Information Systems at the University of Kassel under the direction of Prof. Dr. Leimeister and the Landeswohlfahrtsverband Hessen (LWV), is a groundbreaking initiative to transform the social sector through digitalization.
